# BracketBaker

Bracket Baker is an app designed to help people fill out their March Madness bracket for the NCAA tournament. 

It pulls data stored on Dropbox to provide the most up-to-date information about seeding and rankings for teams. Then, it uses a fairly rudimentary alogirthm by assigning a probability to each team then utilizing a random Float to determine which team wins each basketball game. 

It is my second iOS project as I learn Swift programming.

You can find it on the app store here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bracket-baker/id1080444804

Current version on App Store: 1.0 (1.1 pending)

Version on GitHub: 1.2
